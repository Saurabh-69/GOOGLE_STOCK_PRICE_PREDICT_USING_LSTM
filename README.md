## Introduction
This project aims to predict Google stock prices using machine learning techniques, particularly LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) algorithm. LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) capable of learning long-term dependencies, making it well-suited for time series prediction tasks like stock price forecasting.

## üîç How it Works
1. **Data Collection:** Historical stock price data for Google is collected from reliable financial sources.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** The data is cleaned, normalized, and prepared for analysis. Features such as opening price, closing price, volume, etc., are extracted.
3. **Model Development:** LSTM algorithm is implemented using Python and TensorFlow/Keras. LSTM networks are trained on historical stock price data to learn patterns and relationships.
4. **Model Training:** The trained model learns to predict future stock prices based on historical data.
5. **Evaluation:** The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and others.
6. **Prediction:** Finally, the trained LSTM model is used to predict future Google stock prices.

## ü§ñ LSTM Algorithm
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture designed to overcome the limitations of traditional RNNs in capturing long-term dependencies. It achieves this by introducing memory cells and various gates (input, output, forget) that regulate the flow of information. LSTM networks are well-suited for sequential data analysis and time series prediction tasks due to their ability to remember and utilize past information over extended periods.

## üìä Benefits for Stock Prediction
- **Handling Long-Term Dependencies:** LSTM networks can effectively capture long-term dependencies in time series data, which is crucial for stock price prediction where past trends influence future prices.
- **Learning from Sequential Patterns:** LSTM models can learn from sequential patterns and incorporate past information to make accurate predictions about future stock movements.
- **Flexibility and Adaptability:** LSTM networks are highly flexible and adaptable, capable of learning complex relationships in the data and adjusting their predictions accordingly.
